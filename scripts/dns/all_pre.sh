# all_pre.sh - DirectAdmin Global Pre-Hook for DNS Changes
#
# Description:
#   This is a DirectAdmin global pre-hook that intercepts CMD_DNS_ADMIN
#   and CMD_DNS_CONTROL actions before they modify DNS zones. It creates
#   a backup of the current DNS zone file to enable diff comparison in
#   the post-hook.
#
# DirectAdmin Hook Location:
#   /usr/local/directadmin/scripts/custom/all_pre.sh
#
# Environment Variables (provided by DirectAdmin):
#   $command  - The DA command being executed (e.g., CMD_DNS_ADMIN)
#   $action   - The action being performed (e.g., save, add, delete)
#   $domain   - The domain being modified
#   $username - The user performing the action
#
# NIS2 Compliance:
#   This hook supports audit trail requirements under NIS2 Directive
#   (EU) 2022/2555 by preserving DNS zone state before modifications.
